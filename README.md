## Websites I Recommend 

- [Strava](https://www.strava.com) - Strava is a site that I use to track my cycling and running activities either virtually or outside.  I can see my heartrate zones and power zones and see routes that I've ridden.
- [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) - Zwift is an online platform where cyclists and runners from all over the world can do virtual rides using a bike that is attached to an indoor trainer.  I use it nearly daily for fitness and I even do virtual races (I've placed in the top 3 in several races).
- [My Comic Shop](https://www.mycomicshop.com) - This site is great for buying and selling comics books of any era (golden, silver, bronze and modern).
